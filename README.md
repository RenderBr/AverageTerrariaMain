# Average's Survival Plugin Base

- Hi, it's me Average! Just wanted to say that apart of our service to the Terraria community is open-sourcing all our plugins. ALL OF 'EM! 
- This is the plugin base (the one that adds alot of special functionality) for our Survival server. At: t.averageterraria.lol:7778
- Provides a lot, but probably not recommended for other servers. There is and will be NO DOCUMENTATION for this plugin, and some parts are not very self-explanatory. Either way, use at your own risk!

**DEPENDENCY**: TimeRanks

# What does this add to the game so far?

- Pre-Made (currently commented out) custom mob drops
- Enemy / Boss scaling
- Integration with TimeRanks to provide (/givebal) - Admin only cmd
- Custom tile drops (Custom tree behaviour, ore behaviour, etc.)
- Auto broadcast functionality
- Safezone functionality at Spawn region
- WIP: Clans (currently not very functional)
- Bounties (requires TimeRanks)
- /bosses progression command
- Currently non-functional Regen chests script (will probably be removed soon)
- /donate and /beg commands (item donation pool, in reward for TimeRank currency)
- /discord, /apply, /info commands
