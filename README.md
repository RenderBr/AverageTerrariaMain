# Average's Survival Plugin Base

- Hi, it's me Average! Just wanted to say that apart of our service to the Terraria community is open-sourcing all our plugins. ALL OF 'EM! 
- This is the plugin base (the one that adds some functionality) for our Freebuild server. At: t.averageterraria.lol:7777
- Provides a lot, but probably not recommended for other servers. There is and will be NO DOCUMENTATION for this plugin, and some parts are not very self-explanatory. Either way, use at your own risk!

**DEPENDENCY**: [TimeRanks](https://github.com/RenderBr/TimeRanks/tree/master)

# What does this add to the game so far?
